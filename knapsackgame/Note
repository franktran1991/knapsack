Run: 
/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.2/bin/php artisan serve

Best way:

- Skinny Model + Skinny Controller 

Model:
- Knowledge Layer of Application, not Database layer
- Dont need understanding whatsover of any http request, how we return or response
- Validation at the model for readability

Database:
- Every model connect to DB by extending the Eloquent
- Use migration to add/edit Db

Routing:
- Should use route name for all the form places or redirect. It will automatically update when we change in routing
